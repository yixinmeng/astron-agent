# AGENTS.md

## Project Overview

Astron Agent is an enterprise-grade Agentic Workflow development platform. It includes the console frontend and backend, multiple core microservices, a plugin system, and deployment and infrastructure configuration. The repository uses a multi-language, multi-module structure. The primary languages are TypeScript, Java, Python, and Go.

## Repository Structure

### Console

- `console/frontend`
  - React 18 + TypeScript + Vite frontend application
  - Responsible for the console UI, agent creation, chat interface, workflow visualization, model management, plugin marketplace, and related features
- `console/backend`
  - Java Spring Boot backend
  - Responsible for console REST APIs, SSE, authentication, management capabilities, and business aggregation
  - Main submodules:
    - `hub`
    - `toolkit`
    - `commons`

### Core Microservices

- `core/agent`
  - Python FastAPI service
  - Responsible for the agent execution engine, Chat/CoT/CoT Process Agent, plugin invocation, and session context handling
- `core/workflow`
  - Python FastAPI service
  - Responsible for workflow orchestration, execution, debugging, versioning, and event handling
- `core/knowledge`
  - Python FastAPI service
  - Responsible for the knowledge base, document processing, vectorization, retrieval, and RAG integration
- `core/memory`
  - Python module
  - Responsible for conversation history, short-term and long-term memory, and session persistence
- `core/tenant`
  - Go service
  - Responsible for multi-tenancy, space isolation, organization management, and resource quota management
- `core/plugin`
  - Plugin capability directory
  - Includes plugin services such as `aitools`, `rpa`, and `link`
- `core/common`
  - Python shared capability module
  - Responsible for abstractions around authentication, logging, observability, databases, cache, message queues, object storage, and other infrastructure concerns

### Other Directories

- `docs`
  - Project documentation, deployment, configuration, and module descriptions
  - For architectural understanding, refer first to `docs/PROJECT_MODULES_zh.md`
- `docker`
  - Docker Compose and related infrastructure configuration
- `helm`
  - Helm Charts and Kubernetes deployment configuration

## Typical Communication Flows

- Frontend -> Console Backend: HTTP/REST, SSE
- Console Backend -> Core Services: HTTP/REST
- Core Services -> Core Services: Kafka event-driven communication

## Behavioral Guidelines to Reduce Common LLM Coding Mistakes

Merge these with project-specific instructions as needed.

Tradeoff: These guidelines prioritize caution over speed. Use judgment for trivial tasks.

### 1. Think Before Coding

Do not assume. Do not hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them instead of choosing silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Identify what is confusing and ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

Write the minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- Do not add features beyond what was asked.
- Do not add abstractions for single-use code.
- Do not add "flexibility" or "configurability" that was not requested.
- Do not add error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and the same result could be achieved in 50, rewrite it.
- Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:

- Do not "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Do not refactor things that are not broken.
- Match the existing style, even if you would normally do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it. Do not delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports, variables, or functions that become unused because of your changes.
- Do not remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.
- Use this test: every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

Define success criteria. Iterate until verified.

Turn tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" -> "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" -> "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" -> "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

1. [Step] -> verify: [check]
2. [Step] -> verify: [check]
3. [Step] -> verify: [check]

Strong success criteria allow you to work independently in a loop. Weak criteria such as "make it work" require constant clarification.

These guidelines are working if there are fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites caused by overcomplication, and more clarifying questions before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## Modification Recommendations

- Before making changes, first identify the target module. Do not modify shared layers directly before understanding the call chain.
- If a change involves multiple services, make the call chain and dependency direction explicit.
- If Kafka, Redis, MinIO, or authentication is involved, evaluate the impact on other services first.

## Important Notes

- Before implementation, first confirm the target module, upstream and downstream dependencies, and the verification approach.
- Prefer official SDKs when writing code.
- Do not focus only on whether the feature works. It must also satisfy the corresponding language module's formatting, linting, type checking, static analysis, and testing requirements.
- If the work is a bug fix, unit tests and integration tests are not required. If it is a complete feature request, unit tests are mandatory, and integration tests should also be added when feasible.
- If it is a complete feature request or a complex bug, add logs at key points as much as reasonably possible to help with troubleshooting, but do not add excessive logging.

## Key Workflow Expectations

1. If unit tests or integration tests are involved, assign the test scenarios and test code to a new subagent for execution. The subagent should report test results back to the main agent. If tests fail, the main agent should fix the issue and hand testing back to the subagent. Repeat this loop for up to 5 rounds. If tests still do not pass after 5 rounds, inform the user. In addition, if any local environment issue appears during testing, ask the user whether local dependencies should be installed. After the user agrees, install the required local environment automatically and continue testing.
2. After the feature work and testing are completed, ask the user whether the project needs to be redeployed. If the user confirms redeployment is needed, start a new subagent to execute the `.codex/skills/astron-agent-server-deploy` skill.
